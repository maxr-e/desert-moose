## Installation

  User must navigate to the repository's local location and run:

### `npm init`, `npm i`.
  
  This is a React App. In the project directory, user can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If the user isn't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, run `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from the project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so the user can have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts for editing by the user.

   * react
   * react-dom
   * @testing-library/jest-dom
